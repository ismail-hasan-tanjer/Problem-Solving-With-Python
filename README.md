# Problem Solving with Python

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Problem Solving with Python** repository! 🚀 This repository is designed to help you improve your problem-solving skills using Python by solving a variety of coding challenges. Whether you are preparing for coding interviews, competitive programming, or just want to enhance your logical thinking, this guide will be useful for you.

## Topics Covered
- 🟢 **Basic Problems** (Loops, Conditionals, Functions)
- 🔵 **Data Structures** (Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries)
- 🟣 **Algorithms** (Sorting, Searching, Recursion)
- 🟠 **Mathematical Problems** (Prime Numbers, Factorials, Fibonacci)
- 🟡 **String Manipulation** (Reversal, Palindromes, Substrings)
- 🔴 **Advanced Topics** (Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Trees)

## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/problem-solving-python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd problem-solving-python
   ```
3. Start solving problems by running the Python scripts:
   ```bash
   python problem1.py
   ```

## Sample Problems
### 1️⃣ Reverse a String
```python
def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]

# Example usage
print(reverse_string("hello"))  # Output: "olleh"
```

### 2️⃣ Find the Factorial of a Number
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```
