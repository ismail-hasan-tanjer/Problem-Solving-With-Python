2️⃣ Problem: Palindrome Check
Description: Given a string. Check whether it is a palindrome (i.e., whether it is the same when reversed).

✅ Python code: 
'''

    
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

# Test 
print(is_palindrome("madam"))  # True
print(is_palindrome("hello"))  # False

'''
3️⃣ Problem: Fibonacci Series
Description: Create a Fibonacci series where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. Starting from 0, 1.

✅ Python code:
'''
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        print(a, end=" ")
        a, b = b, a + b

# Test Run
fibonacci(10)

Problem: Prime Number Check
Description: Check if a number is prime (i.e., not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself).

✅ Python code:
